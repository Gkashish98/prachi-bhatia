                        <h2> EDU GO is the only global fund solely dedicated to education in developing countries. </h2>

                        <h3> There are 29 states in India. Each state has different cities and villages across India. There is no mechanism to identify bright students who are performing well in studies, sports or other activities. EDU GO can acquire data about such students and can be analyzed on different parameters. Such identified students can be provided with extra resources or special attention can be given to their upbringing. </h3>

                        <h1> What we do ? </h1>

                        <h4> We build stronger education systems </h4>

                        <p> EDU GO supports developing country governments to develop good quality education sector plans. Governments take the lead in planning and are accountable for delivery; EDU GO identify exemplary students of all the educational institutions and send the list to the education department. The education department provides facilities to the selected and shortlisted student.</p>

                        <h4> We support students with the greatest needs, and the children most often left behind </h4>

                        <p> EDU GO supports poor exemplary students who needs funding for their future education . Also, EDU GO focuses on reaching the students that are most marginalized and vulnerable including girls, and those who live in an area that are characterized by extreme poverty. EDU GO helps in providing funding based support from different NGOs, organizations and donations if they want to provide.</p>

                        <h4> We mobilize more financing for education </h4>

Also, EDU GO grants strengthen education systems to improve equity, quality.</p>

                        <h4> We also encourage extra-curricular activities </h4>

                        <p> EDU GO supports Extra-curricular activity like – singing, painting, dancing etc. If the eductional department or the any NGO only wants a list of students that are exemplary in extra-curricular activities , then EDU GO can fetch the list of students having expertise in that particular field only.</p>

                        <h4> We also highlight the social issues </h4>

                        <p>EDU GO highlight the social issues such as Child Labour, child trafficking by year wise regulation of data.

                        <div class = "container1"></div>

                        <h1> How we work ? </h1>

                        <p> To identify exemplary students firstly all the educational institutions need to upload the results of students as well as points/certificates of extra curricular activity (activity name, score out of 10 for performance) to the database for a student according to the current class of study. Aadhar number for all the students will always be given (from there students details will be verified).<br>
                        A parent or any other non government institute can also upload scanned copy of result or certificate of any student with his/her Aadhar number and their own details. EDU GO will Cross-check and verify it for the update in the database. One’s (schools and institutions) first login or registration, there will be a unique token, (user id and password) to the Portal. That login will be further verified. So every institution will have a unique user id and password and students' details will be uploaded yearly and updates will be done twice in a year.<br>
                        The second fold of the solution is that the EDU GO will sort the data according to the merit of students. EDU GO will perform the operation with the provided data and present a lesser (according to requirement) students' details. <br>
                        The third and final part is providing the list of exemplary students to the education department and university. Each official and university will also have a login section. The list of exemplary students will be provided according to year, required field. The education department or university can also post the facilities provided to the selected and shortlisted student as a notice.</p>

                        <h1> Education </h1>

                        <h2> Education is a vital human right and plays a key role in human, social, and economic development. </h2>

                        <img src="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/images/icon-ed-boy-girl-sign.png">

                        <h4> Education is a human right </h4>

                        <p>Despite great progress in the last few years, millions of children are still denied their right to education. Restricted access to education is one of the surest ways of transmitting poverty from generation to generation. Education is a vital human right, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Every girl and every boy should have the right to a quality education so that they can have more chances in life, including employment opportunities, better health and also to participate in the political process.</p>

                        <img src="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/images/icon-ed-chart.png">

                        <h5> Investing in education yields significant development benefits </h5>

                        <p> Education reduces poverty, boosts economic growth and increases income. It increases a person's chances of having a healthy life, reduces maternal deaths, and combats diseases such as HIV and AIDS. Education can promote gender equality, reduce child marriage, and promote peace. In sum, education is one of the most important investments a country can make in its people and its future. </p>

                        <img src="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/images/icon-ed-school-conflict.png">

                        <h5> Education is critical during times of conflict </h5>

                        <p> In times of conflict and crisis, children are forced out of school, which contributes to higher drop-out rates and lower completion rates. Having a strong focus on education in these countries is critical, since education promotes stability, good governance, and peace. It can also provide a visible sign of a return to normalcy for children. </p>

                        <img src="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/images/icon-ed-book-letters.png">

                        <h5> A poor quality education is almost like no education </h5>

                        <p> Great progress has been achieved in enrolling children in school around the world. But it's not enough to get children in school, we also need to ensure that they learn to read, count, and acquire the necessary life skills. A special focus has to be given to the most vulnerable and marginalized groups (including children living in fragile and conflict-affected countries, children with disabilities, and girls) who are most likely to be affected because of a lack of well-trained teachers, inadequate learning materials, and unsuitable education infrastructure.</p>

                        <img src="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/images/icon-ed-student-teacher-desk.png">

                        <h5> Good teachers are essential to achieve quality education </h5>

                        <p> Good teachers are essential to solving the global learning crisis and closing the gap between poor and good quality education. Therefore, it is vital that all children have teachers that are well-trained, motivated, are able to identify weak learners, and are supported by well-managed education systems.</p>

                        <img src="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/images/icon-ed-female-students.png">

                        <h5> Educating girls has a multiplier effect </h5>

                        <p> Educated girls and women tend to be healthier, have fewer children, earn more income and provide better health care for themselves and their future children. These benefits also are transmitted from generation to generation and across communities at large, making girls' education one of the best investments a country can make. </p>

                        <img src="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/images/icon-ed-disabilities.png">

                        <h5> Children with disabilities are often excluded from education systems </h5>

                        <p> In many countries, a combination of discrimination, social attitudes, poverty, lack of political will, and poor quality of human and material resources leave children with disabilities more vulnerable to being excluded from education. It is essential that societies adapt their education systems to ensure that these children can enjoy their basic human right without discrimination of any kind. </p>
