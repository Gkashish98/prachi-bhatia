                            <p>Building stronger and more efficient education systems is our mission. Strong education systems can ensure that all children have access to quality education and can serve future generations of children. 
                                    <br> </br>
                                    Our goal is to strengthen education sector planning and implementation. We bring together all education institutions, government officials and NGOs to enable them to contribute at all stages of the child education from analysis to evaluation.
                                    <br> </br>
                                    The most effective means of achieving sustainable global development is solely quality education.
                                    Everyone has a role to play in improving the quality of education. Governments, teachers, schools have a vanguard role to play, along with parents and students themselves.
                                    <br></br>
                                    The process starts by pointing out the gaps in high quality and equitable education. This huge gap has created a learning crisis in global education which in turn is widening social gaps as well.
                                    Education is a critical component which contributes extensively in the human development indices. It is one of the most important ways to attain the goal of sustainable global development.
                                    <br> </br>
                                    A strong education system widens the prospects of opportunities, improves health and bolsters the resilience of communities. Education can bring the elementary shift in the values, actions, and responsibilities of an individual. Schools play a pivotal role in bringing the change, as it starts during the elementary years which are considered to be the most critical in shaping an individual.
                                    <br> </br>
                                    
                                    To help resolve the dire crises of education in the developing countries, concrete and strict policies should be recommended.Government, teachers, parents, and even students in the education sector needs to work towards the implementation of these policies.
                                    <br> </br>
                                    With a well designed set of commitments and targets coupled with effective education programs can instill the importance of achieving the equitable, high quality education for all.
