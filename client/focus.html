                            <p> Children are very vulnerable when it comes to Domestic servitude. Often children are told that they will be offered excellent wages to work as a maid in middle-class homes, but they usually end up being severely underpaid and abused. Every year hundreds of thousands of girls are trafficked from rural India to work as maids. A root cause of commercial exploitation and child trafficking in India is due to lack of education, and the need to support their family.</p>

                            <p> 27% of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. Child marriage is more common among poorer households, with many families marrying off their daughters to reduce their perceived economic burden. Girls are often married off at a younger age or during schooling because less dowry is expected for younger brides. Girls' education benefit her marital family, and educating daughters is therefore seen as less of a priority than educating sons.

                            <p> A large number of children with disabilities do not go to regular schools. While there has been a drop in enrolment of students with visual impairments, there has been a rise in those with multiple disabilities. The percentage of children attending schools is the lowest among those with multiple disabilities. The attitude of parents towards including children with disabilities into mainstream education is also crucial to accomplish the goal of education.</p>

                            <p> Girlsâ€™ education is a strategic development priority. Better educated women tend to be healthier and participate more in the formal labor market, earn higher incomes, have fewer children, marry at a later age, and enable better health care and education for their children. All these factors combined can help lift communities, nations out of poverty. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school and complete all levels of education with the skills.
