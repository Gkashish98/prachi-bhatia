					  <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-top: 10px;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">27% of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. Child marriage is more common among poorer households, with many families marrying off their daughters to reduce their perceived economic burden.
